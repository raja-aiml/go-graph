# Go Migration Plan

Below is a general checklist to plan for a complete migration of code to Go:

1. **Analyze the Existing Codebase**
   - Catalog all services, dependencies, and modules.
   - Identify features that must be re-implemented or replaced in Go.

2. **Design a Target Go Architecture**
   - Outline how the code will be organized into packages and modules.
   - Decide on project layout (e.g., monorepo vs. multiple modules).

3. **Set Up the Go Toolchain**
   - Install the Go SDK and configure environment variables (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH` if needed).
   - Prepare Go modules (`go.mod` files) for dependency management.

4. **Plan Feature Parity**
   - For each existing library, list the equivalent functionality to implement in Go.
   - Determine how to replace third-party dependencies that donâ€™t have direct Go equivalents.

5. **Incremental Migration**
   - Rewrite components one module at a time, starting with core or shared libraries.
   - Use integration or interface layers if you need to run Go code alongside existing code during migration.

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Recreate the test suite in Go (unit, integration, end-to-end).
   - Ensure the test coverage remains comparable to the original project.

7. **CI/CD Adjustments**
   - Modify build scripts to compile and test Go code.
   - Update Dockerfiles or deployment scripts to use Go binaries.

8. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Update README files and docs with Go usage.
   - Provide migration guides and code samples for developers.

9. **Validation and Performance**
   - Benchmark the Go implementation to confirm it meets performance goals.
   - Perform thorough manual and automated testing to validate feature completeness.

10. **Deprecation / Cleanup**
    - Remove old (non-Go) code once the Go implementation is stable.
    - Finalize repository structure to contain only Go code.
